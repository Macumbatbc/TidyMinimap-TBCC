# TidyMinimap-TBCC
TidyMinimap is a small addon that will tidy your minimap by moving all the custom buttons into it's own frame.

There is a slash command (/tidy) that gives you the name of the minimap button you're currently hovering with your mouse. Use this to add buttons that are not automatically picked up to the Settings.lua.
